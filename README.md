## Notes
My changes start at commit 35 https://github.com/petherin/go-concurrency-exercises/commit/dba9ef06ecf604a01481b7b771258f3e0795a56a.

### OS Threads and Goroutines
Goroutines run sequentially in OS threads.

Go will run as many OS threads as there are CPU cores on your machine. `runtime.GOMAXPROCS()` provides this number.

Parallelism is achieved by running goroutines sequentially on multiple os threads.

Each goroutine is given a time slice of 10ms.

### Channels

Default value for channel is `nil`. Reading/writing to a nil channel blocks forever. Create channels with `make` built-in function.

Closing a nil channel panics.

Owner of channel is a goroutine that instantiates, writes and closes a channel.

Channel users should only have a read view into the channel.
